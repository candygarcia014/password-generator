# password-generator

* I did not change the HTML file.  

* I started by declaring all the vars to identify them and clearly organizing the code with the appropriate IDâ€™s  

* I learned about .split after struggling with the string of numbers, letter, and chatracters, but it really helped once I used it. 

* I had a really hard time getting the pw to generate, and I think it was because I was not defining the pwLength properly.

* The prompts and alerts worked properly immediately.  

* The upper, lower, numeric, and special characters are console.logging accurately.  

* The create PW function is giving me a really hard time.
